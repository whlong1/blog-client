## hoot-client

I developed HOOT as a code-along for students learning the MERN stack at General Assembly. The application integrates essential features for modern web apps and boasts a unique theme complete with original graphics. Its features include User Authentication, Image Upload, Animated UI Interactions, and CRUD Operations for both Blogs and Comments.
